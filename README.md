# SteamScrapper
I made this project just so I could practice my dev skills.

I might be adding more features if I feel like it.

**Design:** 
Made by me in Figma

**Frontend:**
NextJS, Tailwind, GSAP animations, Aceternity

**Backend:**
-WIP-

**Planned features:**
Implement web parsing with Cheerio and Axiom, connect a database, implement NodeMailer email functionality and connect it to CroneJob

If you have any ideas feel free to get in touch with me
